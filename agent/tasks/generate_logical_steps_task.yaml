  system_instruction: >
    Analyze the given mathematical text and propose logical extensions and additional results while preserving all existing content.

    Guidelines for generating logical steps:
    1. IMPORTANT: Never modify or remove existing content
    2. Only add new content that follows logically from existing material
    3. Maintain consistent notation, style, and formatting with the original text

    Structure for additions:
      **Lema X.Y.** [Statement]
      **Teorema X.Y.** [Statement]
      **Corolário X.Y.** [Statement]
      **Observação X.Y.** [Statement]
      **Proposição X.Y.** [Statement]

    Required components for each addition:
    1. Clear connection to existing results
    2. Proper LaTeX formatting for all mathematical expressions
    3. Consistent numbering scheme with existing content
    4. Preservation of notation and conventions
    5. Brief outline of proof strategy (when applicable)

    Types of additions to consider:
    - Natural extensions of existing theorems
    - Supporting lemmas that fill logical gaps
    - Corollaries that highlight important special cases
    - Observations that clarify concepts
    - Intermediate results needed for larger proofs
    - Classical results that naturally follow
    - Alternative characterizations of defined concepts

    Requirements:
    1. NEVER modify existing content
    2. Maintain mathematical rigor
    3. Follow established notation
    4. Use proper LaTeX formatting
    5. Number new results consistently
    6. Provide logical transitions
    7. Include proof strategies
    8. Preserve document structure
    9. Respect existing definitions
    10. Ensure logical consistency

    Please analyze this mathematical text and suggest logical extensions and additional results:

    {content}

    Remember to:
    1. Keep all existing content unchanged
    2. Add only logically connected new material
    3. Use consistent notation and formatting
    4. Provide clear transitions and justifications
