        "Finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) formalize sequential decision-making problems, where actions influence immediate and future rewards, requiring a balance between immediate and delayed gratification.  The agent-environment interaction in MDPs occurs in discrete time steps. The agent receives the environment's state (St \u2208 S), selects an action (At \u2208 A(s)), and receives a numerical reward (Rt+1 \u2208 R) and a new state (St+1), generating a trajectory: So, A0, R1, S1, A1, R2, S2, A2, R3, ...",
        "In a finite MDP, the sets of states, actions, and rewards (S, A, and R) are finite. The environment's dynamics are fully characterized by the probability function p(s', r|s, a) = Pr{St=s', Rt=r | St\u22121=s, At\u22121=a}, representing the probability of transitioning to state s' and receiving reward r, given state s and action a. This function allows computing state transition probabilities p(s'|s, a) and expected rewards for state-action pairs r(s, a) and state-action-next-state triples r(s, a, s'). The Markov property dictates that probabilities depend solely on the immediately preceding state and action, not on earlier states and actions; therefore, the state should include all relevant past information.",
        "The agent's goal is to maximize cumulative long-term reward, formalized by the reward hypothesis: all goals can be represented as maximizing the expected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (the reward).  The return (Gt) is a specific function of the reward sequence. For episodic tasks (with a final time step T), Gt is the sum of rewards (Gt = Rt+1 + Rt+2 + ... + RT). For continuing tasks, the discounted return is used (Gt = Rt+1 + \u03b3Rt+2 + \u03b3\u00b2Rt+3 + ...), where \u03b3 (0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1) is the discount rate, determining the present value of future rewards.  Returns at successive time steps are related: Gt = Rt+1 + \u03b3Gt+1.",
        "A policy (\u03c0) maps states to probabilities of selecting actions. \u03c0(a|s) is the probability of At=a if St=s. Value functions, v\u03c0(s) and q\u03c0(s, a), estimate how good it is to be in a state or take an action under policy \u03c0, in terms of expected return.  v\u03c0(s) = E\u03c0[Gt | St=s] (expected return starting from s and following \u03c0). q\u03c0(s, a) = E\u03c0[Gt | St=s, At=a] (expected return starting from s, taking action a, and following \u03c0). Value functions satisfy recursive relationships, expressed by the Bellman equation for v\u03c0: v\u03c0(s) = \u03a3a \u03c0(a|s) \u03a3s',r p(s', r|s, a) [r + \u03b3v\u03c0(s')].",

        "An optimal policy (\u03c0*) is one whose expected return is greater or equal to that of all other policies for all states. Optimal policies share the same optimal state-value function, v*(s) = max\u03c0 v\u03c0(s), and the same optimal action-value function, q*(s, a) = max\u03c0 q\u03c0(s, a).  q*(s, a) = E[Rt+1 + \u03b3v*(St+1) | St=s, At=a]. The Bellman optimality equation for v* is: v*(s) = maxa \u03a3s',r p(s', r|s, a) [r + \u03b3v*(s')].  For finite MDPs, this equation has a unique solution and can be solved using various methods.  Once v* is known, determining an optimal policy is relatively easy: any policy that assigns non-zero probability only to actions maximizing the Bellman optimality equation is optimal. Any policy greedy with respect to v* is optimal.",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is about learning from interaction to achieve a goal. RL's online nature enables focusing on frequently encountered states, unlike other approaches to solving MDPs. The chapter addresses the inherent tension between breadth of applicability and mathematical tractability and the trade-offs in applying RL beyond MDPs. RL involves evaluative feedback and an associative aspect (choosing different actions in different situations). The choice of state and action representations can strongly affect performance, and selecting appropriate representations is crucial."

The agent selects actions, and the environment responds to these actions, presenting new situations and generating numerical rewards that the agent seeks to maximize over time.",
        "The interaction between the agent and the environment is modeled as a sequence of discrete time steps (t = 0, 1, 2, 3,...). At each step, the agent receives a representation of the environment's state (St \u2208 S), selects an action (At \u2208 A(s)) based on this representation, and receives a numerical reward (Rt+1 \u2208 R) and transitions to a new state (St+1).",

        "The dynamics of the MDP are defined by the function p(s', r | s, a) = Pr{St=s', Rt=r | St\u22121=s, At\u22121=a}, which is the probability of observing the next state s' and reward r, given the previous state s and action a. This function is crucial for planning and learning optimal policies.",
        "The Markov property states that the state must include information about all past agent-environment interactions that make a difference for the future. This enables the agent to make decisions based solely on the current state, without retaining a complete history. The MDP framework is flexible and can be applied to various problems where time steps can represent fixed intervals or arbitrary decision-making stages, and states and actions can have different forms and levels of abstraction."

For example, a chess-playing agent should be rewarded only for winning, not for achieving subgoals like taking opponent's pieces. Providing rewards in such a way that maximizing them also achieves the desired goals is crucial for the agent's learning process."

In episodic tasks, where the agent-environment interaction naturally breaks into subsequences called episodes, the return is the sum of rewards up to a final time step T.  Each episode ends in a special terminal state, followed by a reset to a standard starting state or a sample from a standard distribution of starting states.",
        "In continuing tasks, where the interaction doesn't naturally break into episodes, the return is the discounted sum of rewards: Gt = Rt+1 + \u03b3Rt+2 + \u03b3\u00b2Rt+3 + ..., where \u03b3 (0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1) is the discount rate. The discount rate determines the present value of future rewards; a reward received k time steps in the future is worth only \u03b3^(k-1) times what it would be worth if received immediately. When \u03b3 = 0, the agent is \"myopic\" and only maximizes immediate rewards. As \u03b3 approaches 1, the agent becomes more far-sighted.",

If the agent is following policy \u03c0 at time t, then \u03c0(a|s) is the probability that At = a if St = s. \u03c0 is an ordinary function defining a probability distribution over a \u2208 A(s) for each s \u2208 S.",

Similarly, the value of taking action a in state s under policy \u03c0, denoted q\u03c0(s, a), is the expected return when starting in s, taking action a, and following \u03c0 thereafter: q\u03c0(s, a) = E\u03c0[Gt | St=s, At=a].",

For example, by following policy \u03c0 and maintaining an average, for each state encountered, of the actual returns that have followed that state (Monte Carlo methods). When the number of states is too large, value functions must be maintained as parameterized functions (with fewer parameters than states) and the parameters adjusted to better match observed returns.",

Any policy that assigns nonzero probability only to actions maximizing the Bellman optimality equation is an optimal policy. Any policy that is greedy with respect to the optimal evaluation function v* is an optimal policy.

Due to the online nature of reinforcement learning, more effort can be spent learning to make good decisions for frequently encountered states, at the expense of less effort for rarely encountered states. There may be many states that the agent faces with such low probability that selecting suboptimal actions for them has little impact on the amount of reward the agent receives.",

The reinforcement learning agent and its environment interact over a sequence of discrete time steps. The agent's actions are the choices it makes; the states are the basis for making the choices; and the rewards are the basis for evaluating the choices. Everything inside the agent is known and controllable; its environment, on the other hand, is incompletely controllable and may or may not be completely known.",
